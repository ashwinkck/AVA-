Introducing AVA, a personalised AI chatbot made students to handle their day-to-day tasks.AVA helps in day-to-day task such as help solving homeworks, managing specific tasks, event managing etc. Not just for the academic purpose, AVA will help in the mental well-being of the students by asking about the situations. AVA is powered by gemini 1.5 flash. Can be interacted using voice(though due to some technical limitations, user voice input wasn't included). I used py lib such as pyttsx3, pywhatkit, speech_recognition, threading, tkinter, pyautogui, sys, etc... Currently exploring more in this field and improving AVA for academic and well-being support!
